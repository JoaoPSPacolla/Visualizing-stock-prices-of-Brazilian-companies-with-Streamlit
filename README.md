# Stock Market Analysis â€“ Brazilian Stocks with Streamlit

This project is an interactive web application built with Python and Streamlit to **visualize and analyze the performance of Brazilian stock market (B3) companies**. The app allows users to select multiple stocks, define a custom time range, view a comparative price chart, and calculate the hypothetical return of a portfolio based on the selected assets.

- Function creation and usage
- List manipulation
- Loops and iterations

## ðŸŽ¯ Motivation and Learning

This project was developed as a way to deepen my understanding of the **Streamlit** library, exploring its power and simplicity for building data-driven applications.

The inspiration and foundational knowledge came from **Hashtag ProgramaÃ§Ã£o**, specifically the **Streamlit course**.

Overall, the experience showed that **Streamlit is a highly practical and efficient tool**, perfect for prototyping and showcasing **Data Science** and **Data Analysis** projects.
